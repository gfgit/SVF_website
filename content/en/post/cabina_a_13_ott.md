The old Signalbox A of Padua opens again to the public on October 13th, from 10.00 to 17.00. It will be possible to see old control apparatus of the station, repaired by the association.

You can access Signalbox A from Sarpi street, near Cason Hotel. Kids can bring model trains to make them run on our internal layout.
